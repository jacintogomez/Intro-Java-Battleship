# Java Battleship Game

This is a Java remake of the boardgame Battleship that my partner and I worked on in our Java class. The user plays the game against a computer with a built in BFS ship finding algorithm. The game can be saved to a database midway through and reloaded later on.

## Steps to run: 

### Without database:
(just the game, no save state/reloading capabilities)
1. Clone repo
2. In `src/battleship` run the `NoSaveState.java` file

### With database:
1. Clone repo
2. In `src/battleship` run the `RunThisApplication.java` file
